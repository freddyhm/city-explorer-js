[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freddyhm/city-explorer-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freddyhm/city-explorer-js)

Curated list of interesting things to do in the cities I've lived in.

This app will mainly be used to play around with the following:

- Building a REST API with Node.JS
- TDD with Jest and Cypress test frameworks
- Mongodb and Mongoose
